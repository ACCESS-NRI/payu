===========================
Configuring your experiment
===========================

This section outlines the configuration of an individual experiment, which is
stored in the ``config.yaml`` file.

Configuration files are written in the YAML_ file format. YAML allows us to
store and configure both individual fields as well as higher data structures,
such as lists and dictionaries. Data can also be encapsulated in larger
structures. This is indicated by whitespace in the file, which is significant
in YAML.
